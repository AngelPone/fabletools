## Comments

This is a joint submission with fable and feasts. These packages are
interdependent in their examples and functionality, so all packages will need
to be installed prior to checking the packages.

fabletools should be installed first, and then fable and feasts.

Unfortunately due to this dependency, the packages could not be tested using 
win-builder. Instead these packages have been checked on Windows using AppVeyor.

Apologies for the added complexity in reviewing this submission.

## Re-submission

* Fixed URL in description.
* Removed VignetteBuilder field from DESCRIPTION.
* Conditionally require suggested packages in examples and tests.
* Fix registration of guide_train.level_guide to ggplot2::guide_train.
* Sped up example for reconciliation to be <10s on win-builder.
